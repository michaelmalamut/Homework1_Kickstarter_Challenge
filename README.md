# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

Louise wants to know how different play campaigns fared in relation to each other. This Analysis Report helps site, with the Kickstarter dataset, a visualization of data of whether campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals were successful, failed or cancelled and how that correlates with the time of year.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

In order to determine the outcome based on launch dates, I successfully created a pivot table pulling data from the Kickstarter worksheet showing launch dates over a span of nine years. The pivot table shows the monthly results within these number of years. Included in this pivot table is whether a launch date given in a specific month either succeeded, failed, or was cancelled. To help further visualize the data, I proceeded to use this pivot table and create a line chart. This line chart helps to distinguish the monthly data and show the data over time very well. For successful launch dates, the data peaks in May at 111 successful launches. For failed launch dates, the data peaks in May at 52. For cancelled launch dates, the data peaks at seven in January.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

In order to determine the outcome based on goals, I successfully created a table in an Excel spreadsheet labeled “Outcomes Based on Goals” showing the range of goals and the number of successes, fails, and cancels. Included in this table is the total number of all projects and the percentage of each category previously listed. The data pulled into this spreadsheet was the dataset of goals from the Kickstarter worksheet. To help to further analyze and visualize this data, I created a line chart of the outcomes based on the goal. The relationship is between the goal and the percentages of whether it succeeded, failed, or was cancelled.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

While I didn’t face any challenges as I compiled my data and created visualizations, there are still challenges that many will face when creating an Analysis report. One challenge someone may face would be selecting the proper chart to visualize the data. While a line chart would be the best option, some may think that choosing a bar chart would be better. In fact, it would not solely because a bar chart would be difficult to see the trend that a line chart offers when visualizing the data and may lead people to face problems in differentiating the information.

## Results

In Outcomes based on Launch date, I can conclude that the best time to launch a campaign would be in the summertime in the month of May. The line chart shows the successful launches peaking in May and dropping afterwards. Another conclusion I have found is that the time of the launch date doesn’t really have a major impact on whether the campaign fails or gets cancelled. The trend line is consistent throughout the line chart.

In Outcomes based on Goals, I can conclude that the most successful goal is less than 1000 where 75.81% of the launches were successful. Meanwhile, the higher the goal, the outcome was least likely to succeed with only 12.5% success at 50,000 or more.

The limitation of this dataset would be the lack of data for the line chart in Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date. The data shows the peak of both successful launch dates and failed launch dates in May. If there were more data recorded for this dataset, it may make it clearer whether there would be another month that may have peaked for the failed launch dates which would concretely show May has the month for only successful launches.

A possible graph that could be used for this Analysis report would be a box and whisker plot chart. This kind of chart allows us to see the variance of data and helps to show the distribution of data points across the dataset. This would all make comparing the data easier and more effective in the decision-making process.
